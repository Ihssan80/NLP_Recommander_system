    "# Mining and Summarizing Customer Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As e-commerce continues to flourish, an ever-increasing volume of customer feedback on products and services is generated online. Popular products often attract hundreds of reviews, creating a rich yet overwhelming source of information for potential buyers. This project addresses the need to make sense of this plethora of reviews by introducing an innovative approach to summarizing customer feedback. Distinct from traditional text summarization methods, this approach zeroes in on extracting and organizing customer opinions about specific product features and categorizing them as positive or negative. Our summarization process diverges from the usual practice of sentence selection or rewriting, focusing instead on pinpointing and collating opinions related to product features. The paper outlines various strategies for effective feature mining, backed by experimental results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is centered around the challenge of feature-based opinion summarization in customer reviews for online products. It encompasses a two-stage process: initially, identifying the product features that customers have commented on, referred to as \"opinion features.\" These features are then ranked by their frequency in the reviews. The second stage is associating each feature with positive or negative sentiments. For each identified feature, we quantify the number of customer reviews expressing positive or negative views and link these specific reviews to their respective features. Our goal is to enhance the review navigation experience for potential customers, making it more straightforward and efficient.\n",

    "### 1. Analyze the Task and Define the Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Define Used Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this critical initial phase, we clearly define the task and establish a comprehensive framework. Our main objective is to extract pivotal features from sentences found in product reviews, which are methodically organized in various folders. We start by identifying essential libraries that are key to processing the reviews, including extracting both implicit and explicit features and determining opinion polarities. The subsequent sections will explore various functions, each uniquely crafted to harness the full potential of these libraries for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2. Read Data from Files in the Folders\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we developed two functions to efficiently navigate through folders and files, where the product reviews are stored, while excluding 'Readme.txt' files:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - `read_files_in_folder`: This function is designed to read and process text files within a specified folder. It efficiently extracts the product names from the file names, using these as keys in a dictionary, with the corresponding processed text file data as values.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - `read_folders`: This function extends the capability of reading text files to multiple folders. It accepts a list of folder names as input and compiles the data into a comprehensive dictionary, encompassing processed information from text files across all the specified folders."

    "### 2. Data Preprocessing and Insights Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second phase of the data processing pipeline, the primary focus is on cleaning, parsing, and structuring sentences for subsequent analysis. The central function, `process_content`, efficiently organizes a list of lines into a structured format. It skips irrelevant lines, identifies review boundaries, parses sentences, and exta  ctlabel s features using regular expressions. The function is adept at handling various scenarios, such as skipping empty or star-labeled lines, separating reviews, and extracting labeled features. This preprocessing stage lays the foundation for gaining insights from the data, providing a structured and organized dataset for further analys for the next step which mainly will be applied on the extracted sentences where some proceses will be applied on them to keep important parts and eliminate useless partsis\n",
    "\n",
    "`preprocess_reviews_in_place`:\n",
    "Now we will take the sentence portion from the entire dictionary of lists. As indicated below, we applied text cleaning by removing stop words from the sentence before tokenizing it into words for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Size Reduction:** Eliminating stop words before tokenization reduces the overall text size, which can lead to faster processing, particularly for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Noise Reduction:** If stop words significantly contribute to noise in the data, removing them early in the process simplifies downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the stop words removal, the next preprocessing step involves POS (Part-of-Speech) tagging of the cleaned tokens. This step, executed with the `pos_tag` function from the NLTK library, assigns a grammatical category or part of speech to each token. This categorization provides valuable linguistic information about the words in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subsequent preprocessing step offers flexibility by providing the option to apply either lemmatization or stemming. Leveraging SpaCy for lemmatization ensures words are transformed into their base or dictionary form, promoting text normalization. Additionally, the code supports stemming using SpaCy, which reduces words to their root form. This adaptability allows users to choose between lemmatization and stemming based on their preferences or the specific characteristics of the text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processed information, now including cleaned, POS-tagged, and normalized tokens, seamlessly integrates back into the original data structure. The `preprocess_reviews_in_place` function encapsulates these preprocessing steps, serving as a versatile tool for optimizing the quality of text data before advancing to subsequent analyses."

    "### 3. Define Relevant Information, Extract Information from Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extract Reviews Features\n",
    "The `extract_features` function plays a pivotal role in the data processing pipeline, meticulously tailored to reveal and categorize pertinent features from the preprocessed text data. Operating within the structured format of a dictionary, where each product encapsulates a series of reviews, this function systematically traverses through the data hierarchy. For each individual product, it intricately navigates through its associated reviews and sentences, meticulously extracting Part-of-Speech (POS) tags from the preprocessed information.\n",
    "The subsequent step in this intricate process involves the application of a meticulously crafted grammar designed for Noun Phrase (NP) chunking. Leveraging a chunk parser, the function adeptly performs NP chunking based on the predefined grammatical rules. This distinctive strategy enhances the extraction of meaningful units from the text, contributing to a nuanced understanding of the linguistic structure.\n",
    "Moving forward, the function strategically captures both NP chunks and individual nouns from the POS tags. This dual approach enriches the extracted features by including both standalone nouns and more complex noun phrases, fostering a comprehensive representation of the linguistic nuances present in the reviews. The culmination involves combining these extracted features into a list, with due diligence to eliminate any duplicates and ensure a concise yet comprehensive representation.\n",
    "The final output of this meticulous process manifests in the form of a dictionary, denoted as `all_features`. Within this dictionary, each product is meticulously associated with a list of features curated from its respective reviews. This granular and systematic approach to feature extraction significantly contributes to the identification and categorization of key elements within product reviews. As a result, the function stands as a pivotal component in the broader analytical framework, offering invaluable insights for subsequent analyses and informed decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Association Rules and Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Association Rules Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "To further enhance the analysis, association rules are extracted from the previously obtained features. The `get_association_rules` function utilizes the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules based on specified support and confidence thresholds. The resulting association rules are stored in the `top_features` dictionary, associating each product with its respective rules.\n",
    " The min_support parameter is set to 0.005, representing the minimum support threshold for an itemset to be considered frequent. In the context of association rule mining, support measures the frequency of occurrence of an itemset in the dataset. Setting a relatively low min_support value, such as 0.005, allows the algorithm to identify frequent itemsets even if they occur relatively infrequently in the dataset. This can help capture more diverse patterns from the reviews (sentences).\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Compactness Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "The compactness_pruning function aims to prune features based on their compactness, ensuring that retained features are meaningful and occur in at least two sentences within close proximity. It defines an internal function, is_compact, which assesses the compactness of a given feature phrase by examining its occurrences in sentences. For a phrase with more than one word, the function counts the number of times it appears in sentences with matching words within a specified distance of each other (default maximum distance is 3). If the count exceeds or equals two, the feature is considered compact. The main function iterates over each product's set of feature phrases in top_features, evaluates their compactness using the internal function, and creates a dictionary pruned_features associating each product with a list of compact features. This process refines the feature set, ensuring that retained features exhibit meaningful co-occurrences in the sentences of the preprocessed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Redundancy Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "The redundancy_pruning function is designed to refine association rules obtained from the extraction of features by eliminating redundant single-word features. It iterates over each product (file) in the dataset, compares the features to the compact features obtained from a previous compactness pruning step, and identifies non-redundant features based on their individual word composition. The function calculates the p-support for each non-redundant feature, representing the number of sentences in which the feature appears within the preprocessed data, and filters out features with insufficient p-support. The resulting redundancy_features dictionary associates each product with a set of meaningful features that have undergone both compactness and redundancy pruning, forming a refined and more concise representation of the essential information within the product reviews. The is_superset helper function is utilized to determine whether one set of words is a superset of another during the redundancy pruning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features Combining\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step involves combining the compact and redundancy-pruned features into a unified set of meaningful features. The `combined_features` dictionary associates each product with a comprehensive list of features that have undergone both compactness and redundancy pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive set of functions and processes, from feature extraction to association rules and pruning, forms a robust foundation for deriving insights and understanding key patterns within product reviews."

    "### 4. Feature Extraction and Sentiment Analysis Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Select Appropriate Algorithm and Implement It\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we compare user-labeled features for every product with the features extracted either before or after association. The process involves iterating through the labeled feature list, checking for the presence of each labeled feature in the top feature list. If a match is found, the true positive counter increases; otherwise, the false positive counter increases. Another iteration is performed on the extracted features list, checking if any of the extracted features are present in the user-labeled list. If not, the false negative counter increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps are crucial for calculating precision and recall, which serve as indicators to evaluate the accuracy of the feature extraction process when compared to user-defined labeled features. The `Features_Evaluation` function is implemented for this purpose, utilizing the `lemmatize_labels` function to lemmatize labeled features for alignment with the pre-extracted features.\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate the results of the `Features_Evaluation` function on two pairs of inputs. The first pair is `Features_Evaluation(result, top_features)`, where `result` is the main dictionary of lists, and `top_features` are the extracted features before associations. The result shows low precision and recall. The second pair is `Features_Evaluation(result, combined_features)`, where combined features include both compact and redundant features after applying association. Precision and recall slightly worsen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extracting Infrequent Features (Explicit):\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve precision and recall, we attempt to extract and include infrequent features. First, we identify features that are in the implicit features (extracted features). We refer to these as explicit features. For explicit features not present in implicit features, we check if there is an adjective before or after the feature. These features are combined with the pre-extracted features (combined = compactness + redundancy). We recalculate precision and recall, observing an improvement in precision but a worsened recall. This is demonstrated by calling `Features_Evaluation(result, final_features)` with final features containing both implicit and explicit features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features Sentiment Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is responsible for providing the polarity for every feature in every product. We use the `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` class from the VADER sentiment analysis tool. VADER is specifically designed for analyzing sentiment in text, providing a score for every review. The scores are accumulated, and the result includes the product, labeled features, extracted features, and the polarity of the sentence (`sentiment_results`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Sentiment Analysis Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step in this iteration of the pipeline involves evaluating the sentiment analysis model's performance. The code compares its predictions with labeled sentiments for specific features in reviews. It calculates true positive, false positive, and false negative counts, as well as precision and recall metrics for each product. The results are stored in the `evaluation_results` dictionary and then printed using a function named `print_results_table`. The exact details of the evaluation depend on the specifics of the labeled features and sentiments used in the comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "As appearing in the evaluation sentiments results, precision and recall gave great results."

    "In future research endeavors, there are several promising directions to enhance the sentiment analysis and feature sentiment extraction processes for product reviews. Exploring advanced deep learning models, including BERT and GPT, could refine sentiment analysis by capturing intricate contextual information. Fine-tuning sentiment analysis models based on domain-specific datasets and incorporating more nuanced approaches, such as sentiment strength analysis and aspect-based sentiment analysis, may provide richer insights into user opinions. Moreover, optimizing the parameters of the Apriori Algorithm enhances association processes and adeptly manages implicit/explicit features. This tuning allows the Apriori Algorithm to excel in discovering frequent patterns, refining the association process by discerning meaningful features. Simultaneously, the utilization of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) techniques proves instrumental in distinguishing between various meanings of words, refining the treatment of implicit features, and elevating sentiment analysis accuracy. Advanced evaluation metrics like F1 score and confusion matrices can offer a more comprehensive understanding of model performance. Addressing challenges such as negation handling and contextual sentiment analysis could further improve accuracy. Integrating user-driven model updates through active learning strategies and encouraging users to provide explicit sentiment labels can ensure continuous adaptation to evolving language patterns. Additionally, leveraging external knowledge sources such as domain-specific ontologies and expanding sentiment lexicons can enhance the model's understanding of product features and sentiments. Collectively, these efforts aim to advance the sophistication and accuracy of sentiment analysis in product reviews."
